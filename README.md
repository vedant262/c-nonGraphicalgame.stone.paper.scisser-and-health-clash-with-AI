# Non-Graphical Game: Rock-Paper-Scissors & Health Clash with AI

## Overview

This repository contains a C++ program featuring two engaging non-graphical games: **Rock-Paper-Scissors** and **Health Clash**. Both games are designed to be simple yet strategic, allowing players to challenge an AI opponent.

### 1. Rock-Paper-Scissors

In this classic game, you play against the AI, with both sides choosing between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game is played over five rounds, and the player with the most wins at the end of the rounds is declared the winner.

**Rules:**
- **Rock** beats **Scissors**.
- **Scissors** beats **Paper**.
- **Paper** beats **Rock**.
- If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.

### 2. Health Clash

Health Clash is a unique game where the player and the AI start with different health pointsâ€”11 for the player and 10 for the AI. The game involves strategic choices between Shielding and attacking, with the outcome of each round affecting the health points of both sides.

**Rules:**
- **Max Attack** deals 2 damage to the opponent unless blocked by a Shield, in which case the attacker loses 2 health.
- **Half Attack** deals 1 damage to the opponent unless blocked by a Shield.
- **Shield** blocks attacks but reduces the player's health by 1 if both players choose to Shield.
- The game is played over five rounds, and the goal is to reduce the opponent's health to zero or have more health remaining by the end.

### How to Play

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to choose between the two games. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to make your choices in each round.

- **Rock-Paper-Scissors** is selected by entering `1`.
- **Health Clash** is selected by entering `2`.

Enjoy the games, and good luck defeating the AI!
